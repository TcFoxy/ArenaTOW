Summary:
  This is the League of Crafters official plugin. This plugin uses BattleArena to setup a MOBA style arena that spawns towers, minions and nexus. The two teams battle to destroy the opposite nexus. Should be Fun!

Features Include
- Nexus (Elder Guardian):
Each Arena must have two Nexi, (Red and Blue for the respective teams). When either nexus is destroyed the game is finished. The nexus has a powerful, long-range attack that targets enemy minions and enemy players.

- Tower (Golem):
Each arena can have multiple Towers for each team color. The stationary towers will target enemy players and Minions with fireball attacks in a 5x5 area.

- Minions (Zombies):
Minion spawn periodically and take a configurable path to the enemy nexus. The Minions wear colored hats that correspond to their team color. They will attack Minions, Towers, Nexus, and Players in that order.

- No friendly fire
Entities on the same team don't hurt each other, including players.

- Extremely Configurable:
All Nexus, Tower, Minion Spawning and Player spawning locations are up to you! Minions take a path that is marked by you!
